      <h2>Cart</h2>
      <p>A cart page is an essential part of an e-commerce website. It is the page where users 
      can pile up what they want to buy from the website and then simply checkout by paying online. 
      To comprehend what a cart page does, think of it as a normal shopping cart in a store. People can keep adding whatever 
      they want to buy in the shopping cart, and later, check out at the counter. Similar is the case with a cart page, 
      only that the shopping is done online on an e-commerce website. </p>
